* Sometimes we need to have collections of data, meaning data that is grouped together that has meaning.
    - In javascript there are two types of collections:
        - arrays
        - objects

* Array is an ordered collection of values. There is an order of the items stored.

* Arrays are mutable, meaning you can change the elements it contains.
    - You can even add an element at an index that goes behond the strings current last value, and that added value would be added with success.

* We often use const with arrays, to avoid our references to arrays to change.
    - The contents of the array can change, but the reference is the same.
