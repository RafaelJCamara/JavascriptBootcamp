* You can define strings using double quotes (") or single quotes (')

* In javascript, strings are index.

* There are two terms that are confusing when we speak about the primitive data types: null and undefined.
    - Null: Means the intentional absence of value. Must be assigned.
    - Undefined; Variables that do not have assigned value. This is what you find with more frequence. Ex. when you go to an array index that has no value.

* You can determine the type of a value using the 'typeof' operator.
