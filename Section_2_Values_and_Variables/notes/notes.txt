* There 7 primitive types in Javascript, which can be seen in the following list (only the first 5 are the most used):
    - Number
    - Boolean
    - String
    - Null
    - Undefined
    - Symbol (less used)
    - BigInt (less used)


* Two important things that exist in the numeric realm are NaN (Not a Number) and Infinity.
    - NaN indicates the absense of numeric value (ex. 0/0)
    - Infinity indicates a really big number (to obtain infinity we can do the following operation: 1/0)

* To create a variable in Javascript, there are two main keywords we can use: let or const.
    - let variable: 'let age = 30'
    - const variable 'const age = 30'

* There was an older way of creating variables, which is using the var keyword. But, as I've said, is not used as much today.

* When we are defining variables, by using the 'let' keyword, if we try to create another variable with the same name, we will get an error.

* When we use the 'const' keyword, the value we define in the variable declaration, is the value it will have in the application's lifetime.
