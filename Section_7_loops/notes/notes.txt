* There's a special keyword that we use inside loops which is the "break" keyword.
    -  When we encounter this keyword, the loop will exit.

* We don't want to use a "for of" loop when we want to access the index of the iteration.

* For of loops won't work natively in objects.

* For in loops iterate over objects properties.
